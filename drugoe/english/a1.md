## [Verbs + to + infinitive and verbs + -ing](https://test-english.com/grammar-points/a1/verbs-infinitive-verbs-ing/)

### Verbs + **-ing**

&#x20;\
Some verbs in English are followed by another verb in the **-ing** form. The most common of these verbs are verbs of liking and disliking: **love, like, enjoy, don’t mind, don’t like, hate**. If we use another verb after these verbs, it often takes the **-ing** form.

* _I **love going** to the gym._&#x20;
* _I **like reading**._&#x20;
* _I **enjoy travelling**._&#x20;
* _I **don’t mind cooking**._&#x20;
* _I **don’t like doing** homework._&#x20;
* _I **hate getting** up early._&#x20;

The second verb is in the **-ing** form in the past too.

* _When I was a child I **hated going** to school._ (NOT ~~I hated went to school~~.)



### Verbs + **to** + infinitive

&#x20;\
Many verbs in English are followed by **to** + infinitive. Some of these verbs are: **forget, hope, learn, need, offer, plan, remember, start, want** and **would like**.

* _I **forgot to turn off** the light._&#x20;
* _I **hope to see** you soon._&#x20;
* _I**‘m learning to drive**._&#x20;
* _We **need to arrive** early._&#x20;
* _She **offered to help** us._&#x20;
* _We **are planning to go** to France._&#x20;
* _**Remember to lock** the door._&#x20;
* _I **want to go** home._&#x20;
* _I **would like to buy** a new computer._&#x20;

The second verb takes the **to** + infinitive form in the past too.

* _I **wanted to go** home._ (NOT ~~I wanted to went home~~.)

&#x20;

**would like**

&#x20;\
The verb **would like** (or **‘d like**) is different from **like**. We use **would like + to** + infinitive and we normally use **like** + **-ing** verb to talk about general preference.

* _I**‘d like to study** English._&#x20;
* _I **like studying** English._&#x20;

The meaning is also different.

* _I**‘d like to study** English._ (=I want to do it.)
* _I **like studying** English._ (=I enjoy it.)

We use the question **would you like…** when we offer or suggest something.

* _**Would you like** a cup of coffee?_
* _**Would you like** to dance with me?_
