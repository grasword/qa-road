### Predictions

&#x20;\
Use **will** to talk about something that you think will happen.

* _I think he’**ll win** the election._
* _He **will be** a good doctor._

Use **be going to** to talk about something that you see is going to happen (there is present evidence).

* _Don’t drive like a crazy man. We’**re going to have** an accident!_
* _The doctor said I’**m going to have** a girl._

Sometimes there’s little difference between **will** and **be going to** for predictions. Compare:

* _The conference starts in 10 minutes. We **are going to be** late._ (=I can **see** that we cannot be at the conference in 10 minutes)
* _We need to hurry up. We’ll be late for the conference._ (=I **think** we will be late)

&#x20;

### Decisions

&#x20;\
Use **will** for decisions that you take at the moment of speaking (instant decisions).

* _‘Oh, we don’t have sugar.’ ‘Don’t worry, I’**ll buy** some.’_

Use **be going to** for decisions that you have already taken at the moment of speaking (intentions or plans).

* _‘Why are you undressing?’ ‘Because I’**m going to go** for a swim.’_

Compare these two sentences:

* _‘Sarah said she needs to talk to you.’ ‘Oh, I didn’t know. I’**ll call her** in a minute.’_ (=I took the decision **while** having this conversation.)
* _‘Sarah said she needs to talk to you.’ ‘Yes, I know. I’**m going to call her** in a minute._‘ (=I took the decision **before** having this conversation.)

## [Asking questions in English – Question forms](https://test-english.com/grammar-points/a2/asking-questions-in-english/)

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (28).png>)

**Questions in general**

&#x20;\
If we want to ask a question in English, the order is **QWASM**: **Question word, Auxiliary verb, Subject, Main verb**. In **Yes-No questions** (questions where the answer is **yes** or **no**), there is no Question Word.\
&#x20;

**Questions with be as the main verb**

&#x20;\
When **be** is the main verb, it is used as the **Auxiliary** in the question, and then we don’t have a **Main verb** after the Subject.\
&#x20;

**Auxiliary verbs**

&#x20;\
In the position of **Auxiliary**, we can use **be**, **do**, **have** or any modal verb: **can, could, will, would, should**, etc.

**Have** is only an auxiliary verb in the form **have got** and in the **present perfect**.

* _**Have** you **got** any brothers or sisters?_
* _What **have** you **cooked** for lunch?_

For other uses of **have**, we need an auxiliary verb (**do**, **did**) for questions.

* _What time **did** you have dinner yesterday?_ (NOT ~~had you dinner~~)
* _**Do** you **have** to do it now?_ (NOT ~~Have you to do it~~)

**Have got** only has a present form. It does not have a past form.

* _**Did** you **have** many toys when you were a child?_ (NOT ~~Had you got many toys when you were a child?~~)

### &#x20;Question words

**how much**

&#x20;\
We can use **how much** to ask about the price of something.

* How much is the jacket?&#x20;

**how + adjective**

&#x20;\
We can use **how + adjective** (any adjective) as a question word.

* _**How tall** are you?_
* _**How fast** is your car?_

&#x20;

**which vs what**

&#x20;\
We can use **which + noun**, and we can also use **what + noun**. We use **which** when there are a small number of possible answers. Look at the difference:

* _**Which** car do you like, the red or the blue?_ (there is a small number of possible answers)
* _‘**What** car have you got?’ ‘A Mercedes.’_ (many possible answers)

## [Subject questions, questions with preposition](https://test-english.com/grammar-points/a2/subject-questions-questions-preposition/)



### Subject questions and object questions

&#x20;\
We use subject questions when we are asking about who, what, etc. did the action. We do not use an auxiliary verb after the question word if the question word (**who**, **what**, **etc**.) is the subject of the sentence.

* _**Who** won the match?_ (NOT ~~Who did win~~ … )
* _**What** happened last night?_ (NOT ~~What did happen~~ … )
* _**How many people** went to the party?_ (NOT ~~How many people did go~~ …)

When we are asking about the object (after the verb) we use the normal order of the English question: **auxiliary verb + subject**. These types of questions are called object questions.\
&#x20;

**Object question vs subject question**

&#x20;

| Jack called <mark style="color:orange;">Teresa</mark>. (Teresa = object) | <mark style="color:orange;">Jack</mark> called Teresa. (Jack = subject) |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <mark style="color:orange;">Who</mark> did Jack call? (Who = object)     | <mark style="color:orange;">Who</mark> called Teresa? (Who = subject)   |

&#x20;

### Questions with preposition

&#x20;\
In informal or spoken English, when a question word needs a preposition, the preposition goes at the end of the question (after the verb or after verb + object if there is an object). We don’t use the preposition at the beginning.

* _I played tennis **with John**._ ⇒ _ **Who** did you play tennis **with**?_&#x20;
* _I work **for a multinational company**_ ⇒  _  **What** company do you work **for**?_
* _We usually talk **about sports**._ ⇒ _**What** do you usually talk **about**?_&#x20;
