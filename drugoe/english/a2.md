### Predictions

&#x20;\
Use **will** to talk about something that you think will happen.

* _I think he’**ll win** the election._
* _He **will be** a good doctor._

Use **be going to** to talk about something that you see is going to happen (there is present evidence).

* _Don’t drive like a crazy man. We’**re going to have** an accident!_
* _The doctor said I’**m going to have** a girl._

Sometimes there’s little difference between **will** and **be going to** for predictions. Compare:

* _The conference starts in 10 minutes. We **are going to be** late._ (=I can **see** that we cannot be at the conference in 10 minutes)
* _We need to hurry up. We’ll be late for the conference._ (=I **think** we will be late)

&#x20;

### Decisions

&#x20;\
Use **will** for decisions that you take at the moment of speaking (instant decisions).

* _‘Oh, we don’t have sugar.’ ‘Don’t worry, I’**ll buy** some.’_

Use **be going to** for decisions that you have already taken at the moment of speaking (intentions or plans).

* _‘Why are you undressing?’ ‘Because I’**m going to go** for a swim.’_

Compare these two sentences:

* _‘Sarah said she needs to talk to you.’ ‘Oh, I didn’t know. I’**ll call her** in a minute.’_ (=I took the decision **while** having this conversation.)
* _‘Sarah said she needs to talk to you.’ ‘Yes, I know. I’**m going to call her** in a minute._‘ (=I took the decision **before** having this conversation.)
